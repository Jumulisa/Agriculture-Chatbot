How does mulching help?,"Mulch reduces evaporation, suppresses weeds, moderates soil temperature, and can add organic matter as it breaks down.",soil_water,easy,water_irrigation
How do I choose drought-tolerant crops?,"Select varieties with short maturity and deep roots: sorghum, millet, cassava, cowpea. Use mulching and staggered planting to spread risk.",crop_selection,medium,crop_mgmt
What is the capital of France?,"I only answer agriculture topics. Try asking about crops, soils, irrigation, or pests.",ood_rejection,easy,ood_rejection
How often should I rotate crops?,Rotate crop families every season (or at least annually). A 3–4 year rotation helps break pest/disease cycles and improves soil nutrient balance.,crop_rotation,easy,crop_mgmt
What are good storage options for maize?,"Use hermetic bags, metal silos, or sealed plastic drums; keep off the floor and away from walls; check for pests monthly.",postharvest,easy,postharvest
How do I control aphids organically?,"Use strong water sprays, introduce natural enemies (lady beetles), apply neem oil or insecticidal soap, and remove infested tips.",ipm,easy,pests_diseases
Can you fix my smartphone screen?,"I’m focused on agriculture questions like crops, soils, water, and pests. Please ask a farming-related question.",ood_rejection,easy,ood_rejection
What are signs of nitrogen deficiency?,"Yellowing leaves starting from older leaves, stunted growth, and low tillering in cereals indicate nitrogen deficiency. Confirm with soil or leaf tests.",soil_nutrients,easy,soil_fertility
How do I prevent fungal diseases?,"Improve air flow with proper spacing, irrigate at soil level, rotate crops, remove infected residues, and use resistant varieties or fungicides if needed.",disease_management,easy,pests_diseases
Should I buy hybrid or open-pollinated seed?,Hybrids give higher yields but you must buy fresh seed yearly; open-pollinated varieties are cheaper and can be saved with some yield trade-off.,seed_choice,easy,economics
What is Integrated Pest Management (IPM)?,"IPM combines prevention, monitoring, and targeted controls (cultural, biological, mechanical, chemical as last resort) to keep pests below economic thresholds.",ipm,easy,pests_diseases
How often should I irrigate tomatoes?,Irrigate 2–3 times per week depending on weather and soil; keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Drip irrigation is ideal.,irrigation,easy,water_irrigation
What crops are best for sandy soils?,"Root crops like carrots, peanuts, and sweet potatoes perform well in sandy soils. Improve water retention by adding organic matter (compost) and applying mulches.",crop_selection,easy,crop_mgmt
How can I harvest rainwater for crops?,"Install gutters into storage tanks, use lined ponds, and channel runoff to infiltration pits or swales. Cover storage to prevent contamination and evaporation.",water_harvesting,medium,water_irrigation
Is burning crop residues good practice?,Avoid burning: it loses nutrients and organic matter and increases erosion. Incorporate residues or compost them instead.,sustainability,easy,sustainability
Should I use urea or NPK?,Use NPK for balanced basal fertilization at planting; top-dress with urea or CAN when crops are established. Follow local recommendations and soil tests.,fertilizer_management,medium,soil_fertility
Which crops fix nitrogen naturally?,"Legumes such as beans, peas, cowpea, and clover fix nitrogen through symbiosis with rhizobia. Inoculate seeds if soils lack native rhizobia.",soil_nutrients,easy,soil_fertility
How can I improve soil fertility organically?,"Apply 5–10 tons/ha of compost or well-decomposed manure, rotate with legumes, retain crop residues, and avoid burning. Test soil to target amendments.",soil_fertility,easy,soil_fertility
How can I reduce postharvest losses in grains?,"Dry to safe moisture (~12–13%), use airtight or hermetic storage, clean stores, and control rodents. Handle gently to avoid breaking grains.",postharvest,medium,postharvest
What is conservation agriculture?,"It is minimal soil disturbance, permanent organic soil cover, and diverse crop rotations. It improves soil structure and long-term productivity.",sustainability,medium,sustainability
How do I calibrate a knapsack sprayer?,"Measure nozzle output per minute, walk a known area at normal pace, and adjust pressure/nozzles to apply the recommended rate per hectare.",application,medium,safety_apps
How should I plan planting around rainfall?,Use local seasonal forecasts and historical data. Plant early-maturing varieties at the onset of rains; stagger planting to hedge against variability.,climate_planning,medium,weather_climate
